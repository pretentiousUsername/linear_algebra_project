	abstract = {The theory of open quantum system is one of the most essential tools for the development of quantum technologies. Furthermore, the Lindblad (or Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) Master Equation plays a key role as it is the most general generator of Markovian dynamics in quantum systems. In this paper, we present this equation together with its derivation and methods of resolution. The presentation tries to be as self-contained and straightforward as possible to be useful to readers with no previous knowledge of this field.},

	title = {Introduction to graphs},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0602129},
	abstract = {Graph theory provides fundamental concepts for many fields of science like statistical physics, network analysis and theoretical computer science. Here we give a pedagogical introduction to graph theory, divided into three sections. In the first, we introduce some basic notations and graph theoretical problems, e.g. Eulerian circuits, vertex covers, and graph colorings. The second section describes some fundamental algorithmic concepts to solve basic graph problems numerically, as, e.g., depth-first search, calculation of strongly connected components, and minimum-spanning tree algorithms. The last section introduces random graphs and probabilistic tools to analyze the emergence of a giant component and a giant q-core in these graphs. The presented text is published as the third chapter of the book "Phase Transitions in Combinatorial Optimization Problem" (Wiley-{VCH} 2005). Together with introductions to algorithms, to complexity theory and to basic statistical mechanics over random structures, it provides the technical basis for the more advanced chapters. These cover the analysis of phase transitions in combinatorial optimization problems, algorithmic and analytical approaches based on statistical physics tools (replica and cavity methods), the analysis of various search algorithms and the development of efficient heuristic algorithms, based on message passing techniques (warning, belief, and survey propagation).},
